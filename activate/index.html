			<div class="col-md-12 section1">	
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<h4>Your account is locked</h4>
			<p>If you have forgotten your email address or your password, just click on the relevant link to retrieve the information. </p>
			<p>Do note that the McAfee does not recognize the multiple forms of the same email address. For example, John18@yahoo.co.uk and John18@yahoo.com will not be recognized as different versions of the same email address.</p>
			<p>Similarly, McAfee passwords have only letters and numbers. They do not recognize alphanumeric characters. When you try to retrieve your password, it is sent to your registered email ID. </p>
			<p>In case, you still cannot get into your account, contact McAfee Customer Service.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<h4>Your subscription expired</h4>
			<p>You need a valid McAfee subscription to be able to use your product. You can check whether the subscription period of all the McAfee products you have bought through your McAfee account.</p>
			<p>At the top of the ‘My Account’ page, click on ‘My Account’ and then, on ‘Subscriptions’. Choose ‘All Expired’ to see which of your security products have expired, and ‘View Active’ to see which ones are still valid.</p>
			<p>If the subscription of your McAfee security has expired, you need to ‘Renew’ it to activate it.</p>
			<p><b>Our McAfee installation experts can also help you via live chat to diagnose and troubleshoot the installation issues, and remove any conflicting security software.</b></p>
